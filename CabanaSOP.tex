This document describes the use of the \texttt{CabanaSOP} class for
creating standard operating procedures for the Cabana research group
at the University of Illinois Chicago. It provides a 2-column layout
with pre-defined headers.

\section*{Metadata}

The standard commands for setting the title, author and date are
functional. Additionally, one can set the date of the last revision,
which can be displayed next to the original creation date. If a
revision is given, it will occupy the center footer, otherwise the
date parameter will be used. An e-mail address can also be added.

\section*{Hazards}
The primary hazard for this procedure is a repetitive stress injury,
caused by poor wrist support. Proper wrist support should be used for
both keyboard and mouse. Additionally, the display should be kept
close to eye level.
